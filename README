Veriwell
===================================

Veriwell is a verilog simulator. It is compliant to verilog 95, but
does not fully support it. The most notable missing feature is the 
support for strengths.

This package also integrates support for dumping lxt waveform files.
These files can be used with the gtkwaves waveform viewer.

Quick Start
-----------
tar -zxvf veriwell.tar.gz
cd veriwell
./configure
make
make install

AMD64 Support
-------------
For AMD64 targets the --enable-m32 switch may be used
when running configure to force a 32 bit version. Note 
specifing this switch is equivilent to running 
./configure CFLAGS=-m32 LDFLAGS=-m32.

Lxt support for Gtkwaves (1.*) requires libz to
be installed. Lxt support may be disabled by using
the configuration switch --disable-lxt.

Enjoy!
